  <h2>ABOUT INFINITY</h2>
  <p>The MEDCYCLOPEDIA derived from the word Encyclopedia, a unique platform created by Infinity Educare, focuses mainly on medical and allied health sciences education in India and overseas. As the name suggests is not just an application, itâ€™s an extension of our dreams, our vision, passion and faith. Our aim is to create a digital platform for an entire generation of young students aspiring to achieve successful careers in the medical profession. Made possible with months of research, development, marketing, promotions, efforts, hard work and dedication of the entire Infinity Team and done with a view to where this platform can be a medium to reduce distance between colleges and students. Medcyclopedia in brief is an extended technology arm which helps students secure medical admissions in India and almost anywhere across the globe, digitally without having to step out their respective locations. They can simply log into our app and have all their work done which earlier required physical involvement. Thankfully, we can now hope to put all that in the past.</p>

<p>Medcyclopedia serves as an encyclopedia for scholars wishing to pursue Medical Education in under graduate, post-graduate, or Super-specialty/ Research Levels. This app brings together more than a decade of experience combined with extensive Information, Expert Counseling and college admissions of choice by giving students 360 degree solutions based on their aspirations, discipline, preferred city, budget and eligibility criteria. This app is a unique platform for information, counseling support and process driven admission assistance by using AI (Artificial Intelligence) giving the users a seamless digital experience on any compatible digital device.
